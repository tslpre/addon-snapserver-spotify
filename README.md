## Notes

For gathering the oauth credentials file, use this: https://github.com/dspearson/librespot-auth

And when configuring the addon, make sure you put the credentials between single quotes `'`

e.g.
```
credentials: '{"username":"...","auth_type":1,"auth_data":"..."}'
```

If you've enabled the librespot cache, make sure to exclude this addon from bacukps, as I haven't yet found a solution not to backup the cache dir.
